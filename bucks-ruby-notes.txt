Buck's Ruby Notes

Environment
  Interpreters
    irb is the standard console interpreter
    pry is an alternative that does nice formatting and color-coding of Ruby objects
    
Outputting for testing, debugging, diagnostics
  print is simplest: outputs string to console, returns nil
  puts is next simplest: outputs string to console with a newline, returns nil
  p gives the most info for debugging: it outputs results of call to inspect, and returns the evaluated code
