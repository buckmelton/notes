Buck's Ruby Notes

Environment
  Interpreters
    irb is the standard console interpreter
    pry is an alternative that does nice formatting and color-coding of Ruby objects
    
Outputting for testing, debugging, diagnostics
  print is simplest: outputs string to console, returns nil
  puts is next simplest: outputs string to console with a newline, returns nil
  p gives the most info for debugging: it outputs results of call to inspect, and returns the evaluated code
  
Getting Input from Console
  puts 'Hello there, what\' your name?'
  name = gets.chomp
  puts 'Hello, ' + name + '!'
  
Basic Syntax

  Comments
  
    # This is a comment
    # Most people do multiline comments like
    # this.
    
    =begin
    Multiline comments can be put between =begin and =end, but not many people do this
    =end

  Semicolons
    Not needed (and it's typically considered good style not to use them),
    unless two statements are on the same line, then they need to be separated by a semicolon
    
  Quotes
    Single quotes and double quotes are the same except:
    - Double quotes must be used if you're doing string interpolation: "Hello #{world_name}"
    - Double quotes must be used when escaping characters: 'a\nb' evaluates to string a\nb; "a\nb" evaluates to a, newline, b
      - Except that you can use single quotes to escape single quotes: 'you\'re'
  
  Variables
  
    Assignment
      composer = 'Mozart'
      composer_age = cur_year - composer_yob
      
  Flow Control
  
    if name == 'Buck'
      puts 'Hello Mr. Melton'
    end
    
    if name == 'Buck'
      puts 'Hello Mr. Melton'
    else
      puts 'Who are you, stranger?'
    end
    
    if name == 'Buck'
      puts "Howdy pardner."
    elsif name == 'Katie'
      puts 'What a lovely name!'
    end
    
    while input != 'bye'
      puts 'Enter:'
      input = gets.chomp
    end
    
    break   
    next    # like 'continue' in other languages
    
  Data Structures
  
    Arrays
      Create New Array
        langs = ['English', 'Hawaiian', 'Portuguese']
        
      Methods on Array
        #length
        #reverse
        #each
          langs.each do |lang|
            puts 'I love ' + lang
          end
        
          Alternatively:
            langs.each {|lang| puts 'I love ' + lang}
            
        #join
          puts langs.join(' - ') # Yields 'English - Hawaiian - Portuguese'
          
        #push
        # pushes element onto end of array
        
        #pop
        # pops the last elemnet of the array
        
        #last
        # returns the last element of the array, but leaves the array untouched 
      
  Methods
  
    Defining a Mathod
  
      def method_name (arg1, arg2, arg3) # parens optional
        # method body here
      end
    
    Calling
    
      object.method_name(arg1val, arg2val, arg3 val)
      
      Note that arithmetic operators are methods
        5 + 5 is just a shortcut for 5.+ 5 where "+" is a method on Integer
        6 * 4 is just a shortcut for 6.* 4 where "*" is a method on Integer
        
    Iterators
      #each
      #times
        3.times do
          puts 'Hip Hip Hooray! '
        end
        
        Alternatively:
          3.times { puts 'Hip Hip Hooray! '}
    
      
Data Conversion

  Integer to Float: two ways: Float(3); 3.to_f
    I don't know why the 3.to_f works.  to_f is not a method on Integer or any of its ancestors, nor on the module Kernel.
    
Classes

    Methods
    
      length
