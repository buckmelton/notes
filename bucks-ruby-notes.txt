Buck's Ruby Notes

Environment
  Interpreters
    irb is the standard console interpreter
    pry is an alternative that does nice formatting and color-coding of Ruby objects
    
Outputting for testing, debugging, diagnostics
  print is simplest: outputs string to console, returns nil
  puts is next simplest: outputs string to console with a newline, returns nil
  p gives the most info for debugging: it outputs results of call to inspect, and returns the evaluated code
  
Basic Syntax

  Semicolons
    Not needed (and it's typically considered good style not to use them),
    unless two statements are on the same line, then they need to be separated by a semicolon
    
  Quotes
    Single quotes and double quotes are the same except:
    - Double quotes must be used if you're doing string interpolation: "Hello #{world_name}"
    - Double quotes must be used when escaping characters: 'a\nb' evaluates to string a\nb; "a\nb" evaluates to a, newline, b
      - Except that you can use single quotes to escape single quotes: 'you\'re'
  
  Variables
  
    Assignment
      composer = 'Mozart'
      composer_age = cur_year - composer_yob
      
Data Conversion

  Integer to Float: two ways: Float(3); 3.to_f
    I don't know why the 3.to_f works.  to_f is not a method on Integer or any of its ancestors, nor on the module Kernel.
